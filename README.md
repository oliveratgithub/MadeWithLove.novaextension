## Source and contributions
Some time ago I started providing these snippets as a GitHub Gist: [made-with-love.html](https://gist.github.com/oliveratgithub/7192c585ce6850692199036d46d3dade).

When I added them to Nova I thought «After all, why shouldn't I share them with the Nova community?». And here it is.

Feel free to contribute via comments or a fork to the original Gist!
